# Tom's Module 7 Welcome Pack

Welcome to module 7 and your capstone project! Essentially the final push before the finish line of graduation. This repo holds some links and information that you'll need during the module, especially during the first few days when you'll be proposing your capstone project ideas for approval.

```txt
⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTE: If you are checking this out before your first capstone week officially begins please make sure you are keeping your pre-capstone project your top priority. All of this should be considered secondary until that project is done.
```

## Module Calendar

This calendar is your primary resource for knowing what you should be working on at any given time and when your deadlines are. Refer to it every day and check it before asking for clarification whenever possible.

## Capstone Project Proposals

You must submit this form and get approval from your lead circle TA before starting any work on your capstone project. Any work you do while waiting for approval may have to be completely re-done based on TA feedback.

[Project Proposal Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScBbMqc8VDb0VmOJduQf1ZEwZsxD3k1DL_uFzJ782LwgBXCZg/viewform?usp=sf_link)
<!-- [Project Proposal Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeGVXOG9IKf3iGPWZRcSMEepB8eS5xQEt4nGhmoFhQBBBBSWA/viewform?usp=sf_link) (updated) -->

Don't over-complicate your capstone, this is essentially a 1.5 week project and the stakes are high. The simpler you keep this proposal, the faster it will be approved and the higher the chance will be that you will knock it out of the park and go on successfully into job search. Choose a project that you feel confident that you could build in half the time you're being given. This is the professional move for an engineer under a tight inflexible deadline.

With all that said don't forget to pick something fun if you can. Regardless we're excited to see what you all pick so we can get you approved!

## Lecture Questions Emoji System

Because the TA's are asked to answer all questions asynchronously when possible and because capstone issues can often take hours to address the TA's will use slack reaction emojis to communicate the status of your question. Please pay attention to these emojis and consider them official communication. If it seems odd to take emojis seriously welcome to the tech world!


# 👀
The eyeballs mean the TA's are aware of the question and are looking into it / discussing it in the Staff Room. There may be other questions ahead of yours and it make take minutes or hours to resolve the question based on the complexity of the problem and how clear the question was, if screenshots or commits were provided etc.

# ✅
The green check means the question seems to have been resolved by a TA or other student. If this isn't correct tag one of the TA's in the thread or re-post the question.

# ⚠️
The alert emoji means the question may not be specific enough or may not show clear evidence of independent student research on AAO, Stack Overflow, Google etc. 

Before the TA's can effectively address the question the student will need to add more information, full-screen screenshots, a description of what you have done so far in terms of research and solution attempts and/or a link to the repo with a recent commit message clearly describing the issue.

Once you have added to the question tag the TA who added the alert emoji in the question thread or re-post a new version of the question in the lecture questions channel.

## Projects with Strong Success Rates

Here are some clone ideas that tend to be associated with successful student capstone projects from the perspective of the TAs, although they are of course no garuantee of success. Some are less work than others, specifically those that can go without AWS and there are definitely more that can be added here, but these ones often correlate with successful and strong looking final projects so keep them in mind.

## Minimul Viable Product / Project

Remember, a minimum viable product is the absolute least you can put out that is also a usable product. For your capstone project this means 2 fully functional CRUD features with validation error messages that are unequivocally intuitive and simple to use by someone who has never seen the app before.

Remember, a successful capsone project does not need AWS, Google Maps, Web Sockets or more than 2 CRUD features. But the 2 CRUD features that you do build need to feel and function complete to pass. Essentially, this image says it all both for your capstone project and future projects in your career. If image files could be made out of solid gold, it would be. Keep it in mind always.

## Daily Standups

Daily standups will take place between groups of 3-5 students from your circle. Each student will take roughly 5 minutes to screen-share their deployed app and code. Specific standup times will always be announced in your circle channel. TA's will ask students a small handful of questions while taking brief notes that are shared with the rest of the module 7 team as well as the PTMs and the Career Quest team.

### Questions for Students:

* When did you last deploy?
* Is all the code you are showing deployed?
* What progress did you make on your goal from yesterday?
* What is your goal for today that you plan to complete before next standup? 
* Does your lead circle TA approve of the goal?
* What is your project status in terms of user stories?

### Other Standup Notes

* If technical questions come up your circle TA will ask you to put them into the lecture questions channel asap as we will not have time to debug during standups.
* TAs will take notes regardless of whether your standup check in seems like it went well or not.
* TA notes will include whether you met yesterdays goal fully / partially / not at all.
* TA notes will also include 3-5 word description of your goal for tomorrow.
